Intro to Erlang slides and code. Presented December 4, 2012 to the Community for F# (http://fpish.net/org/c4fs)

## Erlang? ##
**an intro for geeks who already know a thing or two about functional programming**

The functional programming language Erlang is battle-tested, open-source, and runs great on Windows, Mac and
Linux (both Intel and ARM). What makes it so different from other languages (including functional ones)? How does
Erlang solve hard problems that other languages fail at? How can any language have "reliability, distribution, and
concurrency" as sweet spots? How can the F# community use Erlang?
